  				<p>AKA &#8220;Rabbit Hole #1&#8221;<br> <br>
				It all began in California. Or rather, I should say, it actually began in Crested Butte, CO. I was working remotely having moved there during the pandemic from Washington, DC. I had just finished a Human-centered Design program (shoutout Evan Chan and Thaniel van Amorgen!) and was searching for my next project at Deloitte where I could really dive in. Where I wound up instead was down the rabbit hole that is the realm of Integrated Eligibility work for a State level client. <br>
<br>
18 counties, business process reengineering with no prior eligibility knowledge. Easy right? You already know the answer. I learned a ton on this project, namely, how to learn - how to absorb all that I can even if I don’t understand it. It was like collecting puzzle pieces without knowing what the puzzle even looks like, or how many pieces there are. Even without the “big picture” I was able to find smaller pictures within the overall landscape, and to these counties and county workers, that made all the difference. After all, the smaller pictures were their frames of reference anyways, what they lived in daily. And as my time on the project grew, so did my capacity to see the big picture.  <br>Some lessons I learned: 
		<ul class="dashed">
      <li> <b>People are funny. </b>They’re also passionate about their domain… a listening ear is a most valuable skill to have at any given moment in my tool belt. </li> <br>
      <li><b>Re-engineering business processes is important and impactful... </b> but <b>(!)</b> without the human at the center, I kept returning to the question of who we were really helping. Were we hitting the mark? What even was the elusive mark? </li> <br>
      <li><b>Not only do I enjoy pulling main insights from conversations, I’m also good at it. </b>I love the feeling of piecing together bits of information that were offered up to me as plain rocks, but which actually hide gold nuggets inside. What’s even better is witnessing someone realize their rock is gold.</li> <br>
		<li><b>I work well real time. </b>In person, on site, with the people actually using the system who know it inside and out. Nothing drives motivation to improve processes more than talking to and getting to know the people who it truly matters most to.</li> <br>
    </ul> </p>
<p> Where this rabbit hole left me: <b>I realized I’ve got good vision.</b> Yes, as in, my distance vision and my near vision - I was able to flex these skills on this project, zooming in and out from hyper detail focused (we’re talking step by step processes, here, 40 of ‘em per county) to overarching process and back. Ah, look at that, perfect timing - this leads me to rabbit hole #2. </p>

  				<p> AKA &#8220;Rabbit Hole #2&#8221;<br> <br>
Where were we? Right - <b>my vision.</b> Those muscles I strengthened on my BPR project really came into play on my next project, which was also modernizing a system/UI, but for a Child Support state client. Similar overall focus - we’re still in the world of eligibility at least, but as I soon found out, an infinitely more complicated project. Largely due to some major, and I mean major, backend constraints. <br>
				<br> The system we were working on was designed in the 90s. But, you have to remember, we’re talking the government and public sector here, so the UI was giving 80’s at best. To make matters more complex, we couldn’t change the backend as part of the project restraints. The situation here is almost the reverse of my last project - we have the overall big picture of what the puzzle should look like once completed, however what we don’t have are any of the pieces. Luckily, as you might have been able to tell already, I like puzzles of all sorts. <br>
				<br> My first week on this project, I started in the field conducting research. I didn’t have a lot of time to catch up, orient myself, or even ask questions. I simply observed, engaged with the child support workers, took notes, for 3 days. At the end of the 3rd day, I had one major question for my team - “I understand what we’re doing but… why are we doing it this way?” - and so, I asked it. And when the answer was, “Well… how do you think we should be doing it instead?” <b>I was ready. </b><br>
				<br> While I definitely think coming in with a fresh pair of eyes helped me in that situation, I also think it strongly showcased my knack for research. I collected my puzzle pieces, tossed ‘em all together like a salad, dumped them out and rearranged them a little bit, then rearranged some more, until I saw something that fit with less resistance and more cohesion within our constraints. People say that curiosity killed the cat, but cats have nine lives for a reason don’t they? More lessons learned:
				learned: 
		<ul class="dashed">
      <li> <b>Curiosity is at the heart of research </b>- uncovering information, asking questions, circling back to the root of the issue, redefining the root of the issue, and on and on… and I’m nothing if not curious.</li> <br>
      <li><b>The outliers are the most interesting. </b>One edge case that others might be willing to ignore could actually be the corner piece, if you will, of the puzzle. Everything else should build off of those insights - why doesn’t the system work for them? what are they doing to make it work for them?  </li> <br>
      <li> <b> Conveying why insights are crucial is just as important as conducting the actual research</b> - research is all good and interesting until it’s time to be integrated with design and implementation, and no picture has been painted about why it matters. </li> <br>
		<li> <b>Pushing back on limitations works, if you have the support to back it up.</b> Learning how to stand up for what I saw in the field being at odds with our current/next sprint plans was huge. Finding the line between what’s ideal, feasible, and necessary also only aided in my understanding and communication of our research insights to the rest of the team. </li>
    </ul> </p>
	<p> Where this rabbit hole has currently left me: <b> I love research. </b> I studied cognitive science in undergrad, and it shows. I love it for the same reason why I love history, and writing, and studying language - <b>I’m a storyteller. </b>I think there’s something so satisfying about getting a host of information thrown your way, and being able to pick out important, often overlooked pieces, and shape them into something that the information-thrower might not have even known was contained in those pieces. And I love figuring out how to convey those insights in a way that makes sense to others why they matter at all, and helping carry that over into the actual designs that will circle back to the <b> user who started it all. </b></p>
